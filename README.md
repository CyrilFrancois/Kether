# 👑 Kether
**The Autonomous Project Orchestrator**

Kether is an AI-native project management engine designed for 2026. Unlike traditional tools that simply store tasks, Kether is an **Active Agent Engine**. It bridges the gap between a "To-Do" list and actual code execution by allowing AI agents to understand, decompose, and solve technical problems autonomously.

---

## 🚀 The Vision
Kether (Hebrew for *Crown*) represents the source of intent. The goal is to move from **Manual Management** to **Autonomous Delivery**.

* **Hierarchical Context:** AI agents understand the "Why" (Project) before executing the "How" (Technical Task).
* **The Foundry:** A dedicated space where a "Toolsmith" AI agent builds, tests, and validates the Python tools needed to solve specific tickets.
* **On-Prem Sovereignty:** Run everything locally using Docker. Your data stays in your volumes; your intelligence comes from your GPT keys.

---

## 🛠 Project Architecture
Kether is built as a containerized stack to ensure environment parity and data persistence.

* **Frontend:** React / Next.js (Single Page Application).
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) — The Agent Coordinator & Logic Layer.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 (Persistent via Docker Volumes).
* **Agent Sandbox:** Isolated environment for running AI-generated Python scripts.
* **Intelligence:** OpenAI GPT-4o / GPT-4-turbo (via API Key).

---

## 📂 Mission Hierarchy
Kether organizes work through four recursive layers to provide maximum context to the AI:

1.  **Project:** The North Star (e.g., *Personal Portfolio*).
2.  **Functionality:** Major feature blocks (e.g., *User Authentication*).
3.  **Functional Task:** User-facing requirements (e.g., *Allow password resets*).
4.  **Technical Task:** The code-level mission (e.g., *Update SMTP transport layer*).

## 💻 Technical Setup (Local Dev)

### Prerequisites
* Docker & Docker Compose
* An OpenAI API Key

### Quick Start
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/kether.git](https://github.com/your-username/kether.git)
    cd kether
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    GPT_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=kether_dev_pass
    DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:kether_dev_pass@db:5432/kether
    ```

3.  **Launch the Stack:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    * **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
    * **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
    * **Database:** Port `5432` (Data persisted in `./kether_db_data`)

## 🏗 The Three Tabs

### 1. Dashboard Overview
A high-level "Command & Control" view. Monitor the **Agent Pulse**, see which agents are currently coding, and track the advancement of every project at a glance.

### 2. Workspace (PM)
The interactive board for managing the 4-layer hierarchy.
* **Nested Cards:** Visual representation of how subtasks relate to parent functionalities.
* **Smart Attributes:** Cards include AI-calculated difficulty (1-10), priority, and custom tags.
* **AI Decomposition:** One-click decomposition of a "Functional Task" into granular "Technical Tasks."

### 3. The Foundry
The AI's laboratory. 
* **Tool Library:** View available Python tools (Scrapers, Test Runners, File Writers).
* **Toolsmith Agent:** Create a ticket to build a *new* tool. The AI writes the code and runs it in a sandbox.
* **Validation:** Review and approve AI-generated tools before they are promoted to the main library.

---

## 🛡 Security & Persistence
* **Data Persistence:** All database states are stored in the `./kether_db_data` volume. Your project history survives reboots.
* **The Sandbox:** AI-generated code is executed in restricted environments to prevent accidental modifications to the host system.
